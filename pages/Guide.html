                        Advantages of AceStream

                    <p>
                        AceStream uses a peer-to-peer distribution similar to BitTorrent to share live video streams between users. This means that a streamer can set up an AceStream stream, and once users begin to watch the stream, they will help each other to view the stream by uploading the stream to other users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to this efficient peer-to-peer distribution model, streamers are able to provide streams to users at high bitrates, and this means a greater quality stream for the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The majority of streamers are now using AceStream over SopCast as it offers higher quality, and due to it's distributed nature, better protection from content takedowns.
